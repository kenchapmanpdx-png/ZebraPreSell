 I see the likely reason “No Junk. Ever.” is rendering inconsistently. It's not about the content or map loop — it's about how styles are conditionally applied and potentially overridden or conflicting due to:

🔍 Likely Issues
1. ✅ textColorClass gets applied to the <h3> — good
BUT…

2. ⚠️ You’re also overriding that color via this conditional inline:
jsx
Copy
Edit
<p className={`text-base leading-relaxed ${feature.title === "No Junk. Ever." ? "text-white/90" : "text-neutral-dark/80"}`}>{feature.description}</p>
So even if textColorClass is set to text-white, this line ignores it.

✅ Fix: Use textColorClass consistently instead of hardcoded white.

3. 🧱 The background color is using a Tailwind-style class that might not be defined in your tailwind.config.js:
js
Copy
Edit
bg-forest/80
If bg-forest or forest isn’t defined in your custom colors, this will silently fail or fall back to default.

✅ Fix: Use either a real Tailwind color (bg-green-900/80) or define forest in your tailwind.config.js.

✅ Cleaned Up Fix (apply this to your map return):
Replace this block:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<p className={`text-base leading-relaxed ${feature.title === "No Junk. Ever." ? "text-white/90" : "text-neutral-dark/80"}`}>{feature.description}</p>
With this:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<p className={`text-base leading-relaxed ${textColorClass}`}>{feature.description}</p>
And make sure textColorClass is defined cleanly above as you already did:

js
Copy
Edit
if (feature.title === "No Junk. Ever.") {
  bgColorClass = "bg-forest/80";
  iconColorClass = "text-white";
  textColorClass = "text-white/90";
} else {
  bgColorClass = "bg-white/90";
  iconColorClass = "text-sage-dark";
  textColorClass = "text-forest";
}
⚠️ Bonus Check: font-lora
Make sure font-lora is available in your Tailwind theme or linked via Google Fonts:

html
Copy
Edit
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lora:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
And in tailwind.config.js:

js
Copy
Edit
fontFamily: {
  lora: ['Lora', 'serif'],
  // other fonts...
}
✅ Final Note:
If only “No Junk. Ever.” breaks, and not any other card, the issue is 99% this:

Conflicting or missing Tailwind color (like bg-forest/80)

Not applying textColorClass consistently

Possibly stale cache from earlier attempts (force refresh, rebuild project)
