Please apply the following changes to clean up the site layout, improve mobile usability, and simplify content:

🔧 1. Remove the Comparison Table Entirely
Delete the full “Why ZebraWell Leads the Industry” block.

Remove any nav links or jump anchors tied to it.

This content is now redundant and no longer needed.

🔧 2. Update Ingredient Display in AM/PM Product Cards
✅ A. Typography Format
Display each ingredient and its benefit on two separate lines.

Keep ingredient name bold, benefit in regular weight.

Example structure:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="mb-3">
  <p className="font-semibold text-sm md:text-base">Magnesium Malate</p>
  <p className="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-600">Supports energy and muscle tone</p>
</div>
✅ Don’t let the benefit wrap awkwardly or shrink text to fit on one line — it should breathe.

✅ B. Improve Visual Style of Product Sections
Apply these changes to both the AM and PM formula blocks:

Add background: bg-gray-50 or bg-white/90

Add padding: p-6

Add border: border border-gray-200 rounded-lg

Add light shadow: shadow-sm

Optionally tint headers:

AM Formula: use soft gold (bg-yellow-50)

PM Formula: use soft lavender (bg-purple-50)

🔧 3. Condense the “What Makes ZebraWell Different” Grid
✅ A. Reduce Number of Cards
Keep only the top 6–8 strongest cards, for example:

Formulated for EDS, POTS & MCAS

2 Bottles Replace 15

MCAS-Friendly

Therapeutic Doses

No Fillers or Stearates

Third-Party Tested

Smart Science

Designed for Sensitive Systems

✅ B. Tighten Spacing and Layout
Use grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3

Reduce padding to p-4

Reduce icon size to text-2xl

Use gap-4 instead of gap-6 in the grid container

🔧 4. Refine Hero Section
✅ A. Remove Unprofessional/Hokey Lines
Delete: “Formulated by people like you”

Delete: “The Zebra Strong Promise”

✅ B. Optional Replacement (Cleaner, More Professional)
Instead of those lines, insert:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<p className="text-sm text-white/80 italic mt-2">
  Born from experience. Backed by science. Made for the sensitive and strong.
</p>
OR

jsx
Copy
Edit
<p className="text-sm text-white/70 mt-2">
  Designed by caregivers. Trusted by patients. Built for bodies that don’t fit the mold.
</p>
Choose only one, or skip entirely if space feels crowded on mobile.

✅ Copy-Paste Summary
Delete the full comparison table.

In the AM/PM product blocks, display ingredient name and benefit on two separate lines, with only the ingredient name bolded.

Style product blocks with soft background (bg-gray-50 or bg-white/90), rounded corners, padding, and light shadow. Optionally tint AM/PM headers.

In the “What Makes ZebraWell Different” section, reduce to 6–8 key cards, tighten grid spacing, use smaller icons and less padding.

In the hero section, remove the hokey sub-lines (“Formulated by people like you” and “Zebra Strong Promise”). Optionally replace with a more professional, science-backed line.
